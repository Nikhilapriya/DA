This project is based on the Kaggle challenge called 'Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster'

It aims to use existing data regarding passengers aboard the Titanic, including their age, gender, cabin class, ticket fare, etc. to build a model that can predict the survival of a passenger from the test set.

The following steps have been taken to process the data and feed it to various classfication models

    1) correcting aberrant values and outliers
    2) completing missing information
    3) creating new features for analysis
    4) converting fields to the correct format for calculations and presentation
   
Data Cleaning and substitutions for null values
Encoding categorical variables using the sklearn library
Creating new, meaningful features that capture the relevant information better.
Making trial runs with various classification models and assessing accuracy using 5-fold cross validation
